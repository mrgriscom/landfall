unclaimed land:

actually terra nullius
actually claimed by a country (or multiple -- could be marked unclaimed to be 'diplomatic') but country borders were shoddily drawn
land that doesn't actually exist
adjacent borders don't line up exactly and can leave slivers

subdivison no parent:

this is always an error; border should be make to line up with parent; either include land in parent or exclude from subdivison

parent no subdivision:

actually part of subdivision but border shoddily drawn; update border
genuinely not part of any subdivision -- create a meta subdivision to cover it or mark parent as incompletely subdivided
adjacent subdivision borders don't line up exactly and can leave slivers

conflict:

genuine conflict; mark as such
adjacent borders don't line up exactly and can ever so slightly cover each other
border exactly follows coastline. could disambiguate but bad practice because if coastline changes border will not. add buffer to coastline borders.
